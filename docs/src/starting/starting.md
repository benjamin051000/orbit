# Getting Started

This section walks you the basic steps to get Orbit up and running on your local computer.

> ### Command Line Notation
> Throughout the tutorials and the rest of the book, commands will be shown that are used in the terminal. Lines that are entered in a terminal are denoted by starting with a $. The $ is just a special marker; it is not to be entered with the command. Lines that don't start with a $ are typically the output of the previous command.


There are two processes to obtaining and maintaining Orbit:
1. [Installing](./installing.md)
2. [Upgrading](./upgrading.md)

## Seeking Help

Orbit is a package manager and development tool. With learning new tools there is always a learning curve. Orbit tries to make it less intimidating to use by offering help and information in a variety of ways:
- To see a list of common commands and options, just use `orbit` with no arguments.
- To view quick summaries on commands, use `-h, --help` flags.
- To view more detailed manual pages and information, use `orbit help`.

But since you are here, complete documentation can be found on this website.
