This section provides step-by-step instructions through examples of basic ways for interacting with `orbit`.

> ### Command Line Notation
> Throughout the tutorials and the rest of the book, commands will be shown that are used in the terminal. Lines that are entered in a terminal are denoted by starting with a $. The $ is just a special marker; it is not to be entered with the command. Lines that don't start with a $ are typically the output of the previous command.

Before starting the tutorials, it is assumed you possess basic knowledge of the following topics:

- sending commands through the command-line
- digital logic concepts
- navigating your computer's local file system
