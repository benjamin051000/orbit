# The Ground Station

### A series of papers relating to package management within the hardware development ecosystem.

This is a collection of thoughts and ideas on how to think of, design, and implement a package manager for hardware description languages (HDL). Read [motion 0x01](./motion0x01.md) for an introduction and rationale.

The motive is to map out thoughts and ideas in a clear and comprehensive manner to potentially receive feedback and be a reference when designing and implementing the package manager tool.

A white paper outlines the general overview of the problems and proposed solutions to the HDL ecosystem. The remaining papers are organized as _motions_, highlighting that they are proposals open to discussion and review.

## White Paper

The project's [white paper](./white-paper.md) aims to concisely inform the reader about the solutions the project aims to provide for the identified problems in the HDL ecosystem.

## Motions

[motion 0x04](./motion0x04.md) - Handling Dependencies  
[motion 0x03](./motion0x03.md) - Describing Dependencies  
[motion 0x02](./motion0x02.md) - The Role of an HDL Package Manager  
[motion 0x01](./motion0x01.md) - Introduction and Rationale
