This command will set up the current ip for build processes. It will collect

By default, the top level unit and testbench are auto-detected according to
the current design heirarchy. If there is ambiguity, it will show the user
the possibilities.
  
The top level unit and top level testbench will be stored in a .env file to
be set during any following calls to the 'build' command. If a plugin was
specified, it will also be stored in the .env file to be recalled during the
building phase.
  
User-defined filesets are only collected along the current working ip's 
path. Specifying a plugin with `--plugin` will collect the filesets 
configured for that plugin.
  
During the planning phase, a lockfile is produced outlining the exact ip
dependencies required, how to get them, and how to verify them. The lockfile
should be checked into version control and not directly edited by the user.
  
If the current working ip's manifest's data matches its data stored in its
own lockfile, then Orbit will read from the lockfile to create the ip
dependency graph. To force Orbit to build the ip dependency graph from
scratch, use `--force`.
  
If only wishing to update the lockfile, using `--lock-only` will not require

This command will get a package from the internet using the default protocol

Downloads are vital to Orbit's management system as to avoid having to solely 
rely on accessing the internet to get IP. Downloads allow Orbit to quickly
repair broken installations and allow users to learn about IP before installing.

When using a custom protocol, Orbit expects the final fetched repository to
exist within a special directory called the queue. By default, the queue is set
to a temporary directory, but it can be overridden with `--queue <dir>`. After a 
protocol is executed, Orbit resumes the download process by trying to detect the 
target IP and then performing a compression algorithm on the path to store as a 
single file archive. This final archive is special and packed with additional 
bytes, which makes it unsuitable to easily unzip with existing compression 
tools.

A lockfile is required to exist in the current IP in order to download its 
dependencies.

Variable substitution is supported when specifying the "command" and "args"
fields for a protocol. Most notably, the queue is accessed as {{ orbit.queue }}.
See `orbit help protocols` for more information about available variables.

This action may automatically run during an install if the package is missing
from the downloads. See `orbit help install` for more details."""
